	I currently work for a software company selling Performance and Analytics software to enterprises. I've been in this field for two years and I have learned a lot! Essentially, we help IT do their jobs more efficiently and prevent outages. When I'm not working, I like to spend my free time working on my 2013 Honda Civic Si that has 400hp. I also enjoying training and competing in powerlifting competitions. My current squat is 430lbs, bench 280lbs, deadlift 540lbs.
